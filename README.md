# pytest_BDD
This repo is full of working follow along code that i picked up for learning BDD testing. I have 3 folders; simple test, API calls, Web UI.  
Here I am exploring what it means to test in BDD and how to implement such tests.  
Tests are written in Python with pytest, pytest-bdd.  
Features file is written in Gherkin.  

# How to run the tests 
```sh
python3 -m venv venv 
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r req.txt
pytest -sv
```
